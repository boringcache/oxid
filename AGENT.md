# AGENT

This file is the small, always-loaded operating contract for work in Oxid. Do
not expand it with delivery history or feature-by-feature status. Load the
[extended agent reference](docs/agent-reference.md), the
[identity-wallet blueprint](OXID_IDENTITY_WALLET_BLUEPRINT.md), and relevant
[ADRs](docs/adr/README.md) only when the task touches their subject.

## Repository purpose

Oxid is a Rust identity wallet organized around hexagonal boundaries. Domain
and application code own policy; ports describe capabilities; incoming and
outgoing adapters own transport, persistence, platform, protocol, and UI
details. Preserve truthful capability labels and fail closed when required live
evidence, custody, proof, or platform support is unavailable.

The extended reference preserves the detailed prototype provenance, shipped
feature state, architecture rationale, security constraints, and historical
delivery notes formerly embedded here. It remains authoritative where this
index points to it; it is not a required read for unrelated work.

## Delivery authority

- Resolve and fetch the work item's explicit delivery base before starting.
  Product work targets one `milestone-<x.y.z>` train; factory, harness, CI,
  documentation, dependency, and governance work may target `develop` directly.
  Never guess the newest milestone.
- Use a dedicated worktree based on the fetched delivery ref. Never develop
  in a dirty primary checkout and never delete unrelated user files.
- Name issue-backed branches `<type>/issue-<number>`, where `type` is the
  Conventional Commit type that will lead the pull-request title. Do not add a
  descriptive suffix.
- Target the PR at its recorded delivery base. Start as draft. Stacked children
  may temporarily target their parent branch but retain the same final target.
- Automation may merge an issue-backed PR only to a matching
  `milestone-<x.y.z>` branch, through the guarded milestone wrapper, after its
  exact-head critical audit passes. Merges to `develop` and `main`, milestone
  promotion/creation/deletion, releases, and repository settings are human-only.
- Every commit and pull-request title follows the repository contribution
  policy: allowed Conventional Commit type and mandatory scope, exact DCO
  sign-off, and a GitHub-verifiable OpenPGP signature. Before any push, verify
  the full local commit range.
- Install and audit the repository-scoped contribution hooks with
  `./bootstrap.sh --configure-git` and `./bootstrap.sh --check`. Hooks provide
  early feedback; managed worktrees record the branch-specific delivery base
  used by pre-push and review tools. Hosted exact-head verification remains
  authoritative.
- Do not push, merge, change repository settings, accept an ADR, tag, or release
  without the authority required by the active user request.

See [issue-branch delivery](docs/issue-branch-delivery.md) for branch protection,
freshness, and exact required contexts.

## Architecture and security invariants

- Dependency direction points inward. Domain/application crates must not import
  UI, storage, network, GitHub, mobile, or concrete protocol adapters.
- The consumer owns each port. Keep composition explicit and adapters thin.
- Do not invent protocol behavior, cryptographic claims, ledger freshness, or
  custody guarantees. Simulated, cached, indexer-supplied, and proven/live
  states stay distinguishable in types and user-facing behavior.
- Never log, persist, upload, or expose secrets, seed material, private keys,
  witnesses, raw credentials, or sensitive identifiers unless an accepted ADR
  explicitly defines the protected boundary.
- Keep unsafe Rust isolated to already-reviewed platform adapter boundaries.
  New unsafe code requires explicit review and an ADR-level justification.
- Preserve immutable dependency revisions, committed `Cargo.lock`, generated
  artifact provenance, and public-repository hygiene.
- Add or update tests and public documentation with behavior. A green aggregate
  must not hide a skipped change-relevant check.

Consult the extended reference before changing custody, identity, credential,
presentation, protocol, wallet, Compact/ZK, mobile persistence, or native
platform boundaries.

## Productive development loop

Follow [the productive loop](docs/factory/productive-loop.md):

- `/dev-loop prototype issue <n>` selects a local, provisional loop for one
  hypothesis: basic plus explicitly relevant focused checks, at most one
  reviewer, no push/PR/hosted-CI wait, and no merge-readiness claim.
- `/dev-loop production-ready issue <n>` selects the normal affected-target,
  draft, CI, and pre-approval loop. It is the default when no profile is named.
- Dispatch the tracked `dev-loop` agent directly through `pi-subagents`. Never
  wrap `/dev-loop` in `taskflow`: the current detached runner cannot prove its
  peer closure, nested progress, or descendant cancellation in this project.
- Routine work uses a 70% quality target and one automatic review round; all
  mandatory acceptance, correctness, security, provenance, and required-CI
  evidence still must be complete.
- Before adding process, classify solution complexity from reversibility, blast
  radius, and evidence cost. A local ignored cache/package or exact-pinned
  configuration change with a one-command rollback is low complexity: implement
  it directly in the active issue and run one focused smoke. Do not create a
  separate canary, ADR, staging branch, or review round without a concrete
  irreversible, security, data, protocol, or cross-system risk.
- Promotion is explicit: refresh the recorded delivery base, audit prototype gaps,
  invalidate provisional evidence, recompute targets, and run production gates.
  Both profiles retain issue/worktree, contribution, security, process, and
  disk invariants.

1. Keep one remotely driven candidate per parent session and at most two active
   managed delivery worktrees per Git common checkout on a host. Parallel
   parents own different issue worktrees.
2. Run the narrowest meaningful check while editing.
3. Use the bounded draft review for direction; it does not wait for CI. When
   aggregate CI is red on a draft, follow gate coordination if it permits
   `run_draft_gate`, keep the PR draft, and repair required evidence before
   pre-approval.
4. Batch accepted findings, run the target plan locally, then push one coherent
   current-head candidate.
5. Run final correctness/security review and hosted CI once. Resolve blocking
   findings; leave bounded non-blocking polish as a concrete linked follow-up
   issue and visible PR triage comment without another exact-head CI cycle.
6. Invoke independent current-head Claude review only for a high-risk/release-profile
   change, an owner request, or a disputed finding.
7. At merge, post the exact-head `review-triage.mjs` receipt and use the guarded
   milestone-only wrapper for an eligible product increment, or hand a
   `develop`/`main` promotion to a human.
8. After a PR merge, the supervisor records final metrics, leaves the merged
   worktree, and runs `worktree-lifecycle.mjs closeout-pr` with the exact PR,
   path, and head. A dirty, locked, non-canonical, mismatched, or current
   checkout is preserved and reported; unrelated worktrees are never swept.

Automatic review is capped at one routine reviewer. Low-signal refinement
stops. Do not add reviewers, retries, retrospective work, or a second gate to
compensate for a provider or transport failure.

Classify failures by origin before ordering rollback. A shell parser error that
occurs before an agent-generated command starts its named helper is a
recoverable command-construction error, not a harness failure. Preserve valid
scoped edits, inspect mutation state, and allow one corrected invocation within
the existing budget. If it affected only advisory review after required focused
evidence passed, record the gap as follow-up. Missing helpers, pin/admission
failures, helper-originated errors, and failed required validation still stop
fail-closed. Never discard verified work solely because of malformed shell
quoting.

Pi retains loaded instructions and extensions. After changing `.pi/`,
`.devloops`, or installed pins, preserve the branch/head, stop Pi, and restart
it from the canonical checkout. Never assume a long-running process is running
the configuration visible in its worktree.

## Validation

Before starting any emulator, simulator, container, heavy build, background
server, watcher, or disposable worktree, load the
[resource-hygiene skill](.claude/skills/resource-hygiene/SKILL.md). Its
receipt-scoped preflight, pressure-stop, sequential-execution, and cleanup
rules are mandatory even when the task is not primarily about resources.

For Lace ID Portal local or Tailscale E2E work, load the
[Portal Pi skill](.pi/skills/oxid-portal-e2e/SKILL.md) and follow the tracked
[macOS laptop](docs/factory/portal-macos-laptop.md),
[mobile simulator](docs/factory/portal-mobile-simulators.md), and
[physical Android Tailnet](docs/factory/portal-android-tailnet-physical.md)
runbooks.

Run focused checks first. The path planner chooses proportional target lanes:

```bash
delivery_base="${DELIVERY_BASE:?set DELIVERY_BASE to the recorded origin/... ref}"
node scripts/ci/target-plan.mjs \
  --base "$(git merge-base HEAD "$delivery_base")" \
  --head HEAD \
  --event pull_request \
  --delivery-profile production-ready
```

Oxid is a Cargo workspace and has no root `package.json`. Never invent a
generic `npm run verify` fallback. Execute the target planner's Cargo/Just/Nix
commands and only the focused platform command selected for the changed paths.

- L0 `basic`: policy, formatting, architecture, lint, and production compilation
  within five minutes; non-Rust changes avoid the Rust/Nix closure.
- L1 `unit-linux`: workspace unit tests on one target within ten minutes.
- L2 `headless-linux`: hermetic black-box integration within ten minutes.
- L3 lanes: optimized UI release, coverage, quality, Nix package, and Compact
  artifacts run independently on `develop`, `main`, schedules, or explicit
  demand; routine feature PRs do not pay for the full assurance matrix.

Build/toolchain/lockfile changes and unknown diff state fail closed to every
public hosted target. Pull requests use affected lanes; each trusted milestone
or `develop` update and each promotion/release-profile run executes the complete
hosted set. Platform,
Docker, cross-repository, and owner-private dependencies are inventoried in
`docs/factory/ci-target-matrix.md`. Quality/scanner schedules and the nightly
hermetic flake check remain backstops.

## Process, disk, and worktree ownership

- One mutating parent session owns one issue worktree. Never attach two writers
  to the same worktree, target directory, branch, or Pi session file. See the
  [worker topology](docs/factory/worker-topology.md) for local and cloud lanes.
- A parent that spawns a process owns its process group and must clean it in an
  exit/signal path. Tests put cleanup in a trap, not after happy-path assertions.
- Rust targets remain worktree-local; compilation reuse comes from the bounded
  shared `sccache`, not shared mutable target trees.
- Pi packages live once in the common checkout and are resolved from linked
  worktrees.
- Audit before cleanup with `node scripts/worktree-lifecycle.mjs audit`.
  Mutating commands require one exact path, expected head SHA, and `--execute`.
  Never bulk-delete based on a branch name or a gone upstream alone.
- A clean unintegrated worktree may be retired only through the explicit
  owner-approved archive command. It must retain the exact commit under a
  private `refs/oxid-archive/worktrees/<sha>` ref and a mode-0600 receipt; an
  archive is preservation, never evidence that the work was delivered.
- The supervisor owns merged-PR closeout. From outside the selected checkout,
  run `node scripts/worktree-lifecycle.mjs closeout-pr --pr <n> --path
  <absolute-path> --expect-head <sha> --execute`; the command revalidates exact
  hosted merge evidence and refuses current, locked, or ambiguous state.

## Maintaining instructions

Keep this file below 2,000 words. Put durable architecture detail in ADRs,
current product state and historical rationale in `docs/agent-reference.md`, and
factory operations in `docs/factory/`. When instructions conflict, the active
user request and repository delivery/security authority win; record and fix the
contradiction rather than silently choosing the most expensive interpretation.
