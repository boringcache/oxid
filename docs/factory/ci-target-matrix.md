# CI target and dependency matrix

This matrix is the authority for what Oxid means by “all targets.” A target is
required only when its dependencies and trust boundary are available. Public,
deterministic targets may gate a pull request; credentialed networks, physical
devices, and a separate repository remain explicit owner evidence.

## Assurance ladder

| Level | Required evidence | Budget | When it runs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L0 basic | Advisory PR title/body feedback; required DCO, GitHub-verified commit signature, repository contracts, formatting, architecture, lint, and production compilation | 0–5 min | Every PR. Rust compilation is omitted only when the impact plan proves no Rust/build surface changed. |
| L1 host | Workspace unit tests on one Linux host | 5–10 min | Rust, UI, headless, platform, Compact, or build changes; on demand for any PR. |
| L2 component integration | Hermetic headless black-box tests, then deterministic Docker integration when its fixture is ready | 5–10 min for the current hermetic lane; Docker budget pending measurement | Affected host/component changes and on demand. |
| L3 extended | UI feature profiles, optimized UI release audit, coverage, quality, locked Nix package, Compact artifacts | 10–30 min per parallel lane | Affected UI/Compact feature changes where listed below; explicit demand; every trusted `develop` push; release profile. |
| L4 platform/release | WASM, Android, iOS, Portal, standalone Midnight, PreProd, physical-device and real-proof evidence | Target-specific | Scheduled, on demand, or owner-private until each row below has a hermetic hosted runner. |

L0 is an envelope of parallel policy and build contexts rather than one serial
job. `Validate PR title` and `Validate PR body` report advisory findings;
`Verify commit sign-offs`, scanner, and the new `Basic gate` provide required
evidence. Commit signatures remain enforced by GitHub ruleset `21481544`; a
checkout cannot independently verify an unknown contributor's GPG keyring.

## Runnable and planned targets

| Target | Command/evidence | Dependencies | Trigger areas | Budget/evidence | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| `unit-linux` | `./run.sh unit` (workspace core/headless/MCP units; UI/app excluded to their lane) | x86_64 Linux, minimal `ci-rust` shell, sccache | core, UI, headless, mobile/platform, Compact, build | hard 10 min; command SLO retains a 14 min GitHub job cap for cold Nix setup, metrics, and cleanup; historical cold workspace tests 119 s locally | Hosted PR lane |
| `headless-linux` | `./run.sh headless-integration` | same Linux host; no live services | core, headless, Compact | hard 10 min | Hosted PR lane |

| `coverage-linux` | `./run.sh coverage` | minimal `ci-coverage` shell and `cargo-llvm-cov`; host coverage explicitly enables deployment readiness, Tailnet DID publication, standalone wallet, PreProd observation, and recovery UI features that are otherwise selected only by device profiles | explicit feature-PR demand; every `develop`/`main` complete profile | hard 25 min, current-phase 70% line floor; changed production files without an instrumented mapping fail closed and are reported together, while conventional `src/**/tests.rs`, `*_tests.rs`, the reviewed declaration-only composition facade, and the explicit desktop test driver remain non-production | On-demand PR lane and complete-profile backstop |

| `ios-physical` | camera, universal-link, custody and resource evidence | owned signed device, release identity/domains | native/release | not yet complete | Owner release evidence |

The two current stable required CI names remain aggregators. They fail when a
selected child lane fails and succeed when an unselected lane is intentionally
skipped. This changes execution topology without requiring an unsafe one-step
branch-protection migration.

### Capability-ownership metadata routing

Changes to `scripts/architecture/capability-facades.json` inherit the lane of
each changed crate entry: `oxid-ui-dioxus` selects the UI lane and
`oxid-headless` selects the headless lane. Shared or unknown crates, malformed
metadata, and metadata changes that cannot be attributed to a crate select the
shared-core (headless) path fail-closed. Mixed ownership changes select every
affected lane.

```

The target jobs do not depend on `basic`, so a five-minute failure is visible
quickly without turning every other lane into serial wall time. They all depend
only on the immutable plan. In hosted CI, `sccache` uses its object-level
GitHub Actions backend. This lets parallel lanes share compiler objects
without creating an immutable multi-gigabyte
archive for every commit. Minimal CI shells default `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`:
rustc incremental state is local `target/` data that sccache cannot store, so
hosted gates prefer cacheable compiler objects and print per-lane sccache
hit/miss/non-cacheable statistics. The interactive developer shell keeps
Cargo's normal incremental behavior. Local CI shells use a bounded 2 GiB cache
and the local default remains a bounded 10 GiB shared cache. Rust
feedback lanes do not restore the whole Nix store. Pull requests are read-only
cache consumers. On a trusted `develop` push, the unit lane is the sole
hosted object-cache writer; the other five Rust lanes remain read-only.
GitHub's cache-service write quota is shared by a workflow run, and concurrent
writers otherwise lose throttled objects before sccache can reuse them.
Quality uses a minimal shell without archiving the Nix store, preventing a new
roughly 2 GiB immutable cache whenever a Nix expression changes. The locked
package lane may update its bounded Nix-store cache only on trusted
`develop` pushes; PRs restore it without allocating a branch-scoped copy.
It uses `cache-nix-action` v7 in a new namespace so the noisy v6 archive
observed on PR #165 cannot be reused.

### Freezing dependency and crate layers

The current Nix packages use `buildRustPackage` with the whole repository as
one `src`, so any included workspace source change invalidates the final Rust
derivation. The Cargo vendor derivation can be reused while `Cargo.lock` is
unchanged, but Nix cannot yet substitute an unchanged Oxid crate independently.

Introduce finer reuse as a separately measured package migration:

1. Filter Nix sources to manifests, Rust sources, required build assets, and
   fixtures so documentation and harness files cannot alter Rust store paths.
2. Build third-party dependencies as a lockfile/toolchain/target/profile keyed
   derivation (for example, Crane `buildDepsOnly` plus `cargoArtifacts`).
3. Add source-addressed workspace layers in dependency order: foundation and
   ports; domains; applications; adapters/composition; then UI/headless/apps.
   A layer changes only when its source, feature set, compiler, native inputs,
   or an upstream layer changes.
4. Publish those derivation outputs from trusted `develop`/release builds
   to a signed Nix binary cache. PRs use it only as a substituter; GitHub cache
   remains for the Cargo registry and read-mostly compiler objects, never raw
   `target/` trees.

Do not call a crate frozen merely because its path did not change. Reverse
dependencies, features, build scripts, compiler flags, target triple, native
libraries, and toolchain version are part of the cache identity. Promotion
requires two same-input hosted samples, cache-hit telemetry, and a measured
storage ceiling before any new layer becomes required.

## Change ownership

`scripts/ci/target-plan.mjs` maps paths to `docs`, `harness`, `ci`, `core`,
`headless`, `ui`, `platform`, `compact`, and `build` areas.

- Documentation, harness, and CI-only feature changes run L0 and their
  independent policy/scanner contexts without realizing the Rust/Nix build
  graph.
- UI and headless changes select their own consumer lanes rather than both;
  the UI's optimized artifact audit remains separate from its profile/tests.
- Shared core, platform, and Compact changes select both UI and headless
  consumers because their dependency fan-out is cross-cutting.
- Build/toolchain/lockfile changes and an unavailable or empty diff fail closed
  to every hosted public target.
- Root `run.sh` is the repository-wide gate driver rather than a harness-only
  helper. An edit can change the command owned by every lane, so it is a global
  build input and deliberately selects the full hosted matrix.
- `--targets` adds known hosted lanes on demand; unknown or private target names
  are rejected rather than silently accepted.

## Branch profiles

| Repository event | Effective profile | Gate set |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product PR to `milestone-<x.y.z>` | `feature` | L0 plus critical change- and risk-relevant hosted lanes; optional extras remain advisory |
| Push to `milestone-<x.y.z>` | `integration` | every deterministic public hosted lane, in parallel; a red tip pauses automatic merges |
| Factory/harness/CI/docs/dependency/governance PR to `develop` | `feature` | L0 plus change-relevant hosted lanes and requested extras; human merge only |
| Milestone promotion PR or push to `develop` | `integration` | every deterministic public hosted lane, in parallel; human merge only |
| PR or push to `main` | `release` | every deterministic public hosted lane, in parallel |
| manual workflow | selected `feature`, `integration`, or `release` | impacted, public-full, or public-full respectively; extra hosted targets may be named |
| nightly schedule | release backstop | complete hermetic Nix suite |

Milestone trains are the only agent-mergeable targets. `develop` remains the
human-controlled engineering baseline and maps to the internal `integration`
assurance profile after merge; `main` maps to `release`. “Integration” names an
assurance level, not the retired branch. “Release” means all deterministic
public targets; owner-private/device evidence remains a separate explicit
checklist.

## Promotion criteria for missing L4 lanes

A target becomes a required hosted lane only after it has: a deterministic
fixture, a documented credential boundary, a provisioned runner, three timing
samples, a hard timeout, bounded disk/cache use, and a named owner for failures.
Until then it is useful evidence on demand, not a gate that can strand every
developer.
